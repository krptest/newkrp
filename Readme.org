#+TITLE: Readme for newkrp

Preparations for an upgraded version of the Kanseki Repository can be
seen here.  Currently we investigate options for a XML representation
of the various branches in one aggregated XML file.

=KR6c0128-test= is a denormalized version of =kanripo/KR6c0128= for
the purpose of developing the new format.  A first draft of this
sample is here:
[[file:KR6c0128-test/_branches/_xml/KR6c00128.xml][KR6c0128.xml]]


* Format

  
** TEI-KR
   - a scaled down version of TEI.  Need to provide an ODD file
   - first draft in [[file:format/sample-format.xml]]
